-- | Run arbitrary computations in parallel. A pool of workers is initialized, unless Worker

-- will be the same as the order of the resuts of those computations, stored withing the resulting
-- array. Size of the array, which is also the first element in the returned tuple, will match the
-- number of times `scheduleWork` has been invoked. This function blocks until all of the submitted
-- jobs has finished or one of them resulted in an exception, which will be re-thrown here.

-- __Important__: In order to get work done truly in parallel, program needs to be compiled with
-- @-threaded@ GHC flag and executed with @+RTS -N@.
