# massiv

`massiv` is a Haskell library for array manipulation. Performance is one of its main goals, thus it
is capable of seemless parallelization of almost all of operations.

The name for this library comes from the Russian word Massiv (Масси́в), which means an Array.

## Status

__Disclaimer__: The current status of this library is still under development, but it is already at
a rather stable point, so no significant API changes should happen.

## Introduction

Everything in the library revolves around an `Array r ix e` - a data type
family for anything that can be thought of as an array. The type variables,
from the end, are:

* `e` - element of an array.
* `ix` - an index that will map to an actual element. The index must be an instance of the `Index` class
  with the default one being an `Ix n` type family and an optional being tuples of `Int`s.
* `r` - underlying representation. The main representations are:

    * `D` - delayed array, which is simply a function from an index to an element: `(ix ->
      e)`. Therefore indexing of this type of array is not possible, although elements can be
      computed with the `evaluateAt` function.
    * A few more extravagant delayed arrays, which are described in more depth in haddock: `DI`, `DL`
      and `DW`
    * `P` - Array with elements that are an instance of `Prim` type class, i.e. common Haskell
      primitive types: `Int`, `Word`, `Char`, etc. Backed by the usual `ByteArray`.
    * `U` - Unboxed arrays. The elements are instances of the `Unbox` type class. Just as fast as
      `P`, but has a wider range of data types that it can work with. Notable data types that can be
      stored as elements are `Bool`, tuples and `Ix n`.
    * `S` - Storable arrays. Backed by a pinned `ByteArray`s and elements are instances of the
      `Storable` type class.
    * `B` - Boxed arrays that don't have restrictions on their elements, since they are represented
      as pointers to elements, thus making them the slowest type of array, but also the most
      general. Arrays of this representation are element strict, in other words its elements are
      kept in Weak-Head Normal Form (WHNF).
    * `N` - Also boxed arrays, but unlike the other representation `B`, its elements are in Normal
      Form, i.e. in a fully evaluated state and no thunks or memory leaks are possible. It does
      require `NFData` instance for the elements though.
    * `M` - Manifest arrays, which is a general type of array that is backed by some memory
      representation, therefore any of the above `P`, `U`, `S`, `B` type of arrays can be converted
      to `M` in constant time with `toManifest` function. It is mostly useful during constant time
      slicing of manifest arrays, as this becomes the result representation. More on that in the
      [slicing](#slicing) section.

## Construct

Creating a delayed type of array allows us to fuse any future operation we decide to perform on
it. Let's look at this example:

```haskell
λ> import Data.Massiv.Array as A
λ> makeVectorR D Seq 10 id
Array D Seq (Sz1 10)
  [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

Here we created a delayed vector of size 10, which is in reality just an `id` function from its
index to an element (see the [Computation](#computation) section for the meaning of `Seq`). So let's
go ahead and square its elements

```haskell
λ> vec = makeVectorR D Seq 10 id
λ> evaluate' vec 4
4
λ> let vec2 = A.map (^ (2::Int)) vec
λ> evaluate' vec2 4
16
```

It's not that exciting, since every time we call `evaluate'` it will recompute the element, __every
time__, therefore this function should be avoided at all costs. Instead we can use all of the
functions that take `Source` like arrays and then fuse that computation together by calling
`compute`, or a handy `computeAs` function and only afterwards apply an `index'` function or its
synonym: `(!)`. Any delayed array can also be reduced using one of the folding functions, thus
completely avoiding any memory allocation, or converted to a list, if that's what you need:

```haskell
λ> let vec2U = computeAs U vec2
λ> vec2U
Array U Seq (Sz1 10)
  [ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 ]
λ> vec2U ! 4
16
λ> toList vec2U
[0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81]
λ> A.sum vec2U
285
```

There is a whole multitude of ways to construct arrays:
 * by using one of many helper functions: `makeArray`, `range`, `rangeStepFrom`, `enumFromN`, etc.
 * through conversion: from lists, from `Vector`s in `vector` library, from `ByteString`s in
   `bytestring`;
 * with a help of mutable interface in `PrimMonad` (`IO`, `ST`, etc.), eg: `makeMArray`,
   `generateArray`, `unfoldrPrim`, etc.

It's worth noting that, in the next example, nested lists will be loaded into an unboxed manifest
array and the sum of its elements will be computed in parallel on all available cores.

```haskell
λ> A.sum (fromLists' Par [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,2,4,6,8]] :: Array U Ix2 Double)
30.0
```

The above wouldn't run in parallel in ghci of course, as the program would have to be compiled with
`ghc` using `-threaded -with-rtsopts=-N` flags in order to use all available cores. Alternatively we
could do compile with the `-threaded` flag and then pass the number of capabilities directly to the
runtime with `+RTS -N<n>`, where `<n>` is the number of cores you'd like to utilize.

## Index

The main `Ix n` closed type family can be somewhat confusing, but there is no need to fully
understand how it works in order to start using it. GHC might ask you for the `DataKinds` language
extension if `IxN n` is used in a type signature, but there are type and pattern synonyms for the
first five dimensions: `Ix1`, `Ix2`, `Ix3`, `Ix4` and `Ix5`.

There are three distinguishable constructors for the index:

* The first one is simply an int: `Ix1 = Ix 1 = Int`, therefore vectors can be indexed in a usual way
  without some extra wrapping data type, just as it was demonstrated in a previous section.
* The second one is `Ix2` for operating on 2-dimensional arrays and has a constructor `:.`

```haskell
λ> makeArrayR D Seq (Sz (3 :. 5)) (\ (i :. j) -> i * j)
Array D Seq (Sz (3 :. 5))
  [ [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
  , [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
  , [ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ]
  ]
```

* The third one is `IxN n` and is designed for working with N-dimensional arrays, and has a similar
  looking constructor `:>`, except that it can be chained indefinitely on top of `:.`

```haskell
λ> arr3 = makeArrayR D Seq (Sz (3 :> 2 :. 5)) (\ (i :> j :. k) -> i * j + k)
λ> :t arr3
arr3 :: Array D (IxN 3) Int
λ> arr3
Array D Seq (Sz (3 :> 2 :. 5))
  [ [ [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
    , [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
    ]
  , [ [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
    , [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
    ]
  , [ [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
    , [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
    ]
  ]
λ> :t (10 :> 9 :> 8 :> 7 :> 6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :. 1)
λ> :t ix10
ix10 :: IxN 10
λ> ix10 -- 10-dimensional index
10 :> 9 :> 8 :> 7 :> 6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :. 1
```

There are quite a few helper functions that can operate on indicies, but these are only needed when
writing functions that work for arrays of arbitrary dimension, as such they are scarcely used:

```haskell
λ> pullOutDim' ix10 5
(5,10 :> 9 :> 8 :> 7 :> 6 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :. 1)
λ> unconsDim ix10
(10,9 :> 8 :> 7 :> 6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :> 2 :. 1)
λ> unsnocDim ix10
(10 :> 9 :> 8 :> 7 :> 6 :> 5 :> 4 :> 3 :. 2,1)
```

It is important to note that the size type is distinct from index by the newtype wrapper `Sz
ix`. There is a constructor `Sz`, which will make sure that none of the dimensions are negative:

```haskell
λ> Sz (2 :> 3 :. 4)
Sz (2 :> 3 :. 4)
λ> Sz (10 :> 2 :> -30 :. 4)
Sz (10 :> 2 :> 0 :. 4)
```

Same as with indicies, there are helper constructors and type synonyms: `Sz1`, `Sz2`, `Sz3`, `Sz4`
and `Sz5`

Here is how to construct a 4-dimensional array and sum its elements in constant
memory:

```haskell
λ> let arr = makeArrayR D Seq (10 :> 20 :> 30 :. 40) $ \ (i :> j :> k :. l) -> (i * j + k) * k + l
λ> :t arr -- a 4-dimensional array
arr :: Array D (IxN 4) Int
λ> A.sum arr
221890000
```

Alternatively tuples of `Int`s can be used for working with Arrays, up to and
including 5-tuples (type synonyms: `Ix2T` - `Ix5T`), but since tuples are
polymorphic it is necessary to restrict the resulting array type:

```haskell
λ> makeArray Seq (4, 20) (uncurry (*)) :: Array P Ix2T Int
(Array P Seq ((4,20))
  [ [ 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ]
  , [ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 ]
  , [ 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38 ]
  , [ 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57 ]
  ])
λ> :i Ix2T
type Ix2T = (Int, Int)
```

There are helper functions that can go back and forth between indices. Also `Ix n` is an instance of `Num` so basic numeric operations are made easier:

```haskell
λ> fromIx4 (3 :> 4 :> 5 :. 6)
(3,4,5,6)
λ> toIx5 (3,4,5,6,7)
3 :> 4 :> 5 :> 6 :. 7
λ> (1 :> 2 :. 3) + (3 :> 2 :. 1)
4 :> 4 :. 4
```

## Slicing

In order to get a subsection of an array there is no need to recompute it,
unless we want to free up the extra memory, of course. So, there are a few
slicing, resizing and extraction operators that can do it all in constant time,
modulo the index manipulation:

```haskell
λ> let arr = makeArrayR U Seq (4 :> 2 :. 6) fromIx3
λ> arr !> 3 !> 1
(Array M Seq (6)
  [ (3,1,0),(3,1,1),(3,1,2),(3,1,3),(3,1,4),(3,1,5) ])
```

As you might suspect all of the slicing, indexing, extracting, resizing operations are partial,
and those are frowned upon in Haskell. So there are matching functions that can do the same
operations safely by returning `Nothing` on failure.

```haskell
λ> arr !?> 3 ??> 1
Just (Array M Seq (6)
  [ (3,1,0),(3,1,1),(3,1,2),(3,1,3),(3,1,4),(3,1,5) ])
λ> arr !?> 3 ??> 1 ??> 0
Just (3,1,0)
```


In above examples we first take a slice at the 3rd page, then another one at the 1st row (both counts start
at 0). While in the last example we also take 0th element. Pretty neat, huh? Naturally, by doing a
slice we always reduce dimension by one. We can do slicing from the outside as well as from the
inside:

```haskell
λ> let a = resize' (3 :. 3) $ range Seq 1 10
λ> a
(Array D Seq (3 :. 3)
  [ [ 1,2,3 ]
  , [ 4,5,6 ]
  , [ 7,8,9 ]
  ])
λ> a !> 0
(Array D Seq (3)
  [ 1,2,3 ])
λ> a <! 0
(Array D Seq (3)
  [ 1,4,7 ])
```

Or we can slice along any dimension:

```haskell
λ> a <!> (2, 0)
(Array D Seq (3)
  [ 1,2,3 ])
λ> a <!> (1, 0)
(Array D Seq (3)
  [ 1,4,7 ])
```

In order to extract sub-array while preserving dimensionality we can use `extract` or `extractFromTo`.

```haskell
λ> extract' 0 (1 :. 3) a
(Array D Seq (1 :. 3)
  [ [ 1,2,3 ]
  ])
λ> extract' 0 (3 :. 1) a
(Array D Seq (3 :. 1)
  [ [ 1 ]
  , [ 4 ]
  , [ 7 ]
  ])
```

## Computation

There is a data type `Comp` that controls how elements will be computed when calling the `compute`
function. It has two constructors:

* `Seq` - computation will be done sequentially on one core.
* `ParOn [Int]` - perform computation in parallel while pinning the workers to particular
  cores. Providing an empty list will result in the computation being distributed over all available
  cores, or better known in Haskell as capabilities.
* `Par` - isn't really a constructor but a `pattern` for constructing `ParOn []`, thus should be
  used instead of `ParOn`.

Just to make sure a simple novice mistake is prevented, which I have seen in the past, make sure
your source code is compiled with `ghc -O2 -threaded -with-rtsopts=-N`, otherwise no parallelization
and poor performance are waiting for you. Also a bit later you might notice the `{-# INLINE funcName
#-}` pragma being used, often times it is a good idea to do that, but not always required. It is
worthwhile to benchmark and experiment.

## Stencil

Instead of manually iterating over a multidimensional array and applying a function to each element,
while reading its neighboring elements (as you would do in an imperative language) in a functional
language it is much more efficient to apply a stencil function and let the library take care of all
of bounds checking and iterating in a cache friendly manner.

What's a [stencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_code)? It is a
declarative way of specifying a pattern for how elements of an array in a
neighborhood will be used in order to update each element of that array. In
massiv a stencil is a function that can read the neighboring elements of the
stencil's _center_ (the zero index), and only those, and then outputs a new
value for the center element.

![stencil](massiv-examples/files/stencil.png)

Let's create a simple, but somewhat meaningful array and create an averaging
stencil. There is nothing particular about the array itself, but the filter is
a stencil that sums the elements in a [Moore
neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) and
divides the result by 9, i.e. finds the average of a 3 by 3 square.

```haskell
arrLightIx2 :: Comp -> Ix2 -> Array D Ix2 Double
arrLightIx2 comp arrSz = makeArray comp arrSz lightFunc
    where lightFunc (i :. j) = sin (fromIntegral (i ^ (2 :: Int) + j ^ (2 :: Int)) :: Double)
{-# INLINE arrLightIx2 #-}

average3x3Filter :: (Default a, Fractional a) => Stencil Ix2 a a
average3x3Filter = makeStencil (3 :. 3) (1 :. 1) $ \ get ->
  (  get (-1 :. -1) + get (-1 :. 0) + get (-1 :. 1) +
     get ( 0 :. -1) + get ( 0 :. 0) + get ( 0 :. 1) +
     get ( 1 :. -1) + get ( 1 :. 0) + get ( 1 :. 1)   ) / 9
{-# INLINE average3x3Filter #-}
```

Here is what it would look like in GHCi. We create a delayed array with some
funky periodic function, and make sure it is computed prior to mapping an
average stencil over it:

```haskell
λ> let arr = computeAs U $ arrLightIx2 Par (600 :. 800)
λ> :t arr
arr :: Array U Ix2 Double
λ> :t mapStencil Edge average3x3Filter arr
mapStencil Edge average3x3Filter arr :: Array DW Ix2 Double
```

As you can see, that operation produced an array of some weird representation `DW`, which stands for
Delayed Windowed array. In its essence `DW` is an array type that does no bounds checking in order
to gain performance, except when it's near the border, where it uses a border resolution technique
supplied by the user (`Edge` in the example above). Currently it is used only in stencils and
not much else can be done to an array of this type besides further computing it into a
manifest representation.

This example will be continued in the next section, but before that I would like to mention that
some might notice that it looks very much like convolution, and in fact convolution can be
implemented with a stencil. There is a helper function `mkConvolutionStencil` that lets
you do just that. For the sake of example we'll do a sum of all neighbors by hand instead:

```haskell
sum3x3Filter :: Fractional a => Stencil Ix2 a a
sum3x3Filter = mkConvolutionStencil (3 :. 3) (1 :. 1) $ \ get ->
  get (-1 :. -1) 1 . get (-1 :. 0) 1 . get (-1 :. 1) 1 .
  get ( 0 :. -1) 1 . get ( 0 :. 0) 1 . get ( 0 :. 1) 1 .
  get ( 1 :. -1) 1 . get ( 1 :. 0) 1 . get ( 1 :. 1) 1
{-# INLINE sum3x3Filter #-}
```

There is not a single plus sign, that is because convolutions is actually summation of elements
multiplied by a kernel element, so instead we have composition of functions applied to an offset
index and a multiplier. After we map that stencil, we can further divide each element of the array
by 9 in order to get the average. Yeah, I lied a bit, `Array DW ix` is an instance of `Functor`
class, so we can map functions over it, which will be fused as with a regular `D`elayed array:

```haskell
computeAs U $ fmap (/9) . mapStencil Edge sum3x3Filter arr
```

If you are still confused of what a stencil is, but you are familiar with [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) this should hopefully clarify it a
bit more. The function `life` below is a single iteration of Game of Life:

```
lifeRules :: Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8
lifeRules 0 3 = 1
lifeRules 1 2 = 1
lifeRules 1 3 = 1
lifeRules _ _ = 0

lifeStencil :: Stencil Ix2 Word8 Word8
lifeStencil = makeStencil (3 :. 3) (1 :. 1) $ \ get ->
  lifeRules <$> get (0 :. 0) <*>
  (get (-1 :. -1) + get (-1 :. 0) + get (-1 :. 1) +
   get ( 0 :. -1)         +         get ( 0 :. 1) +
   get ( 1 :. -1) + get ( 1 :. 0) + get ( 1 :. 1))

life :: Array S Ix2 Word8 -> Array S Ix2 Word8
life = compute . mapStencil Wrap lifeStencil
```

The full working example that uses GLUT and OpenGL is located in
[massiv-examples](massiv-examples/app/GameOfLife.hs)

# massiv-io

In order to do anything useful with arrays we need to be able to read some data
from a file. Considering that most common array-like files are images,
[massiv-io](massiv-io) provides an interface to read, write and display images in common
formats using Haskell native JuicyPixels and Netpbm packages.

There is also a variety of colorspaces (or rather color models) and pixel types
that are currently included in this package, which will likely find a separate
home in the future, but for now we can ignore those colorspaces and
pretend that `Pixel` is some magic wrapper around numeric values that this
package is capable of reading/writing.

The previous example wasn't particularly interesting, since we couldn't visualize
what is actually going on, so let's expend on it:

```haskell
import Data.Massiv.Array.IO
import Graphics.ColorSpace

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let arr = arrLightIx2 Par (600 :. 800)
      img = computeAs S $ fmap PixelY arr -- convert an array into a grayscale image
  writeImage "files/light.png" img
  writeImage "files/light_avg.png" $ computeAs S $ mapStencil Edge average3x3Filter img
```

you can run it as:

$ cd massiv-examples/ && stack build && stack exec -- examples
```

# Other libraries

A natural question might come to mind: Why even bother with a new array library when we already have
a few really good ones in the Haskell world? The main reasons for me are performance and usability. I
personally felt like there was much room for improvement even before I started work on this package,
and it seems as it turned out to be true. For example, the most common goto library for dealing with
multidimensional arrays and parallel computation is [Repa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa), which I personally was a big fan of for
the longest time, to the point that I even wrote a [Haskell Image
Processing](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hip) library based on it.

Here is a quick summary of how `massiv` compares to Repa so far:

* Better scheduler, that is capable of handling nested parallel computation.
* Still shape polymorphic, but with improved default indexing data types.
* Safe stencils for arbitrary dimensions, not only convolution. Stencils are composable through an
  instance of Applicative
* Improved performance on almost all operations. (I might be wrong here, but so far it looks
  promising and rigorous benchmarks are coming to prove the claim)
* Structural parallel folds (i.e. left/right - direction is preserved)
* Super easy slicing.
* Delayed arrays aren't indexable, only Manifest are (saving user from common pitfall in Repa of
  trying to read elements of delayed array)

As far as usability of the library goes, it is very subjective, thus I'll let you be a judge of
that. When talking about performance it is the facts that do matter. Thus, let's not continue this
discussion in pure abstract words, below is a glimpse into benchmarks against Repa library running
with GHC 8.2.2 on Intel® Core™ i7-3740QM CPU @ 2.70GHz × 8
