Before reporting a bug, please, make sure you the issue has not been reported yet and that you are
using the newest version of the library.

The golden rule is that a bug report should include as much information as it is necessary to
replicate it.

In a perfect scenario, whenever applicable, a bug report would include:

* [ ] A minimal code example that would demonstrate the problem
* [ ] Received vs. expected output
