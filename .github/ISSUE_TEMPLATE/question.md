name: Question
about: Ask a question about massiv and related
---

If you would like to ask a simple question about usage of the library it is better to do so on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/haskell-massiv/Lobby) where people who are willing to answer such
questions, including the author of the library, will be notified, rather than eveyone who is
watching the repo for new features and bug reports.

In case when a question is more complicated and more people in the community could benefit from an
answer, naturally [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/massiv) would be a
more suitable place. Make sure to tag a question with `massiv` and possibly paste a link on gitter.

If you still believe you will reach the right audience by asking a question here in github in form
of an issue, please feel free to do so.
